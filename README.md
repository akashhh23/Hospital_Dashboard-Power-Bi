# Papollo Hospitals Dashboard - Power BI
## Project Overview
This project features an advanced Hospital Management Dashboard created using Power BI to provide insights into the overall performance of hospital operations, patient satisfaction, and service quality. The dashboard aims to help hospital administrators and stakeholders monitor key metrics and make data-driven decisions to enhance healthcare delivery.

## Key Questions Addressed
1. What is the patient admission trend over time?
2. How satisfied are patients with hospital services?
3. Which departments and services contribute the most to revenue and efficiency?
4. How do patient demographics (age, gender, etc.) affect hospital operations?
5. What are the bottlenecks causing delays in services, and how can they be improved?

## Dashboard Highlights
**The dashboard includes:**

▪️**Admissions and Discharge Trends:** Visual representation of patient admissions, discharges, and retention rates over time.

▪️**Patient Satisfaction Analysis:** Overall satisfaction scores and breakdowns by specific services such as staff performance, cleanliness, and wait times.

▪️**Department Performance:** Revenue, efficiency, and service usage metrics for each department (e.g., Emergency, OPD, Inpatient).

▪️**Demographic Insights:** Age, gender, and region-based analysis of patient visits and outcomes.

▪️**Service Utilization and Delays:** Identifying average wait times and potential inefficiencies in the patient care process.

## Features
▪️**Interactive Visualizations:** Key performance indicators (KPIs), line charts, bar charts, and ratings visuals for better understanding of hospital metrics.

▪️**Custom Measures:** Calculated measures using DAX for metrics such as total patient count, average satisfaction score, and wait time analysis.

▪️**Real-Time Insights:** Dynamic slicers for filters based on departments, demographics, and time frames.

▪️**Mobile & Desktop Optimization:** Optimized dashboard design for both mobile and desktop views, ensuring accessibility on all devices.

▪️**Actionable Insights:** Focused on identifying improvement areas to enhance patient experience and streamline operations.

## Technologies Used
▪️Power BI Desktop for designing and analyzing the dashboard.

▪️Power Query for data transformation and cleaning processes.

▪️DAX for creating advanced calculated metrics.

▪️Power BI Service for hosting and sharing the dashboard with stakeholders.

## How to Use
▪️**Explore the Dashboard:** Interact with filters to focus on specific departments, demographics, or time periods.

▪️**Monitor Metrics:** Track KPIs such as patient count, satisfaction scores, and revenue per department.

▪️**Identify Opportunities:** Use insights to improve service quality and reduce operational inefficiencies.
